Business: The business objective that the system needs to satisfy.
    B.1 The system must limit orders based on staff capacity, so that the delivery Service Level Agreement of within 10 minutes of promised delivery is not placed in jeopardy. (A. Manager)
    B.2 The contractor must run simulations based on different price points and delivery volume to project the number of orders needed to achieve ROI or break even. (A. Manager)
User: The actions that a user takes within the system
    U.1 The user must associate their account with payment method (e.g., Falcon Dollars or Credit Card) (Hungry Student 1).
    U.2 Users must have a mobile device with geolocation enabled and be on MU campus (Curious Student).
    U.3 Users should have access to more than one dining facility (N.G.).
Functional: The functions should the system perform
    F.1 The system must present an anticipated delivery time (within one half hour) after user has processed payment on the order (J.P.).
    F.2 The system must provide directions to the delivery point for delivery personel. (N.G.)
Non-Functional: The characteristics that the system should have.
    N.1 The system must render pages in less than 10 seconds after any user action or application event. (UX Expert Lady)
    N.2 The system must generate a unique confirmation code, after payment is processed, both on app GUI and sent through associated email (Marketing Major).
System: Specifications about how the system should be built.
    S.1 The system must use Messiah University Single Sign On (SSO) solution for any accounts with a messiah.edu domain. (Policy IT01.02)
    s.2 The systemmust adhere to current Messiah University security standards for PII and financial transaction info (SSL encryption). (University website)

## 3. Assumptions
Assumption 1: This is a financially viable model.
Assumption 2: There will be enough ordering and delivery volume to make development worthwhile.
Assumption 3: Delivery rules will be developed (i.e. How close g time can delivery orders be made?).
Assumption 4: Managers will have a GUI that allows for quick access and manipulation of menu items in app.
